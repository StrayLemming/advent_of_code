# Advent of code

https://adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I'm using it to practice my Python coding skills. I'm not attempting to get onto the leaderboard or even complete it in the 25 days!

This repo includes the puzzle text input required for the scripts to run.
